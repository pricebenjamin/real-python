# I'm sick of skimming over titles

[Real Python][rp] has some excellent articles about the Python language and
popular Python packages. But, if you're not searching for a particular topic
(i.e., you're just reading for fun), browsing for new articles can be a bit tedious.

Article titles usually only give you a hint into their content. When you're
staring a wall of titles in the face, it's not always easy to tell which ones
will be worth the click. Frequently, however, an article will catch (or fail to
catch) your attention from the introduction alone.

Wouldn't it be nice if I could just skim over the introductions?

## Fetch introductions for all [Real Python][rp] articles

This script depends on `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `html5lib`, and `html2markdown`, all of which can be installed via `pip`.

If you would like use this script, then clone the repo and run the following:

```bash
python fetch.py
```

*__Note:__* The script will take a few minutes to run and will produce lots of
output. Once it's done, files can be found in the `generated_markdown` subdirectory.
A large file (~24 Mib) called `cached_responses.pickle` will also be created. This
file stores all previously fetched articles, allowing you to resume or rerun the
script without bombarding the Real Python website with hundreds of prior requests.

An example markdown file generated by this script can be found [here][example-md].

## Future tasks
- [X] Create a collection of URLs to tutorials on [Real Python][rp] by iterating
over their [list of topics][topics].

- [X] Output a markdown file which contains the title, URL, and introductory
text to each of the extracted tutorials. For example,

```markdown
## [Title of tutorial](url)
<p>In this tutorial, we will learn about...</p>
```

- [X] Add support for fetching a particular topic.

- [X] Fetch author name, publication date, and number of comments, if available

- [X] Make the raw markdown more readable by using reference links

- [ ] Allow option to include Table of Contents for each article

- [ ] Accept a list of topic strings as command line arguments.

- [ ] Sort the tutorials by level of engagement (e.g., number of comments)

- [ ] Implement output formats other than markdown
