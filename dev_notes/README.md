# dev_notes

This folder serves as a location in which to store development notes for individual branches. Notes might contain information such as

* purpose of the branch,
* possible implementations,
* possible APIs,
* ideas for classes / data structures,
* or ideas for functions.

However, there are no strict rules regarding their contents. They simply serve to keep track of ideas while developing.
